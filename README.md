# 🧠 Designing a Custom Transformer-Based LLM for Text Summarization

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to design, build, and train a **custom Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM)** from scratch for the task of **text summarization**. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pre-trained models, this project implements the full Transformer architecture—including encoder-decoder structure, attention mechanisms, and positional encodings—from the ground up.

## 📚 Dataset

We use the publicly available dataset:

🔗 [Text Summarization Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lusfernandotorres/text-summarization-with-large-language-models/input)

This dataset includes long-form text documents along with corresponding summaries, ideal for both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### ✅ Core Components Implemented:
- **Encoder & Decoder Stacks** (6+ layers)
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism**
- **Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks**
- **Positional Encoding**
- **Residual Connections**
- **Layer Normalization**
- **Dropout for Regularization**

### ⚙️ Optional Enhancements:
- Sentence-level or hierarchical attention
- Custom feed-forward block variations
- Scaled embeddings and learnable positional encodings

## 🧠 Summarization Approach

### 🔹 Extractive Summarization (Optional):
- Selects key sentences directly from the source text based on learned importance scores.

### 🔹 Abstractive Summarization:
- Generates novel summaries by learning semantic and contextual representations of the input.

### 🧮 Loss Function:
- **Cross-Entropy Loss** used for sequence generation.
- Supports teacher-forcing during training.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Tokenization (custom tokenizer or BPE)
- Padding and truncation
- Batch preparation using DataLoaders
- Vocabulary creation from scratch

---

## ⚙️ Model Training

- **Optimizer:** Adam / AdamW
- **Scheduler:** Learning rate warm-up followed by cosine decay
- **Batch Size:** Tuned based on GPU availability
- **Regularization:** Dropout, Early Stopping, Validation Monitoring
- **Gradient Clipping** to stabilize training
